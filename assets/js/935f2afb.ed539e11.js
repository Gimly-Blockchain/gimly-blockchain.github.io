The subject associated with the DID can assert control over it using cryptographic proofs. In verifiable data systems, a DID can confirm data\'s origin and ownership by linking it to the proof\'s verification method.","sidebar":"docs"},"basics/introduction":{"id":"basics/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"The realm of verifiable data has expanded rapidly in recent years and continues to progress at an escalated pace. With such rapid innovation, numerous competing standards are inevitable, posing an interoperability challenge. Gimly, designed with flexibility, modularity, and scalability in mind, enables developers to craft a customized system from an ever-expanding list of standards without the stress of interoperability and rapidly evolving specifications.","sidebar":"docs"},"basics/signing_keys":{"id":"basics/signing_keys","title":"Signing & Keys","description":"In the domain of self-sovereign identity and cryptography, private and public keys are integral to secure digital interactions and data encryption. They form the core of the public key infrastructure (PKI).","sidebar":"docs"},"basics/verifiable_data":{"id":"basics/verifiable_data","title":"Verifiable Data","description":"Verifiable data is essentially data that has been endorsed digitally through a cryptographic algorithm. If data undergoes this signing process, the signature can then be verified. In this context, we will examine the most prevalent standard of verifiable data - Verifiable Credentials.","sidebar":"docs"},"hardware_systems_integrations/access_controllers":{"id":"hardware_systems_integrations/access_controllers","title":"Access Controllers","description":"This specification outlines the integration between our SSI system and hardware access controllers.
